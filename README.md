# Recap

Recap is a fully native news reader made for Windows 11 in mind. It was built with C# and WinUI3 as to bring you the full native experience.

As this project is still a work-in-progress, expect some changes to be made, be it performance, ui, or behaviour. All positive of course!

Recap was built for HackClub HighSeas with love, care, and lots of coffee ;p

## What does Recap support?

As it uses the Windows Syndication api, Recap supports both atom and rss.

## What's the roadmap?

Well first of all i'm planning to implement the missing filtering features: Read/Unread and Saved/Unsaved, altough expect more and more as times comes on.

## The app crashes/misbehaves/i want to suggest something

You're welcome to drop an issue for all of those! I'm always open to changes!
